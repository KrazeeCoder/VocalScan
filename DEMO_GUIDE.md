## 🚀 How to Use VocalScan

### 1. Open the Application
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (requires microphone permissions)

### 2. Record Your Voice Sample
1. **Select Sample Type**:
   - Voice/Speech: General voice analysis
   - Sustained "Aaah": Hold "aaah" sound for 10-15 seconds
   - Read Sentence: Read clearly
   - Cough: Natural cough sounds
   - Breathing: Deep breathing patterns

2. **Record Audio**:
   - Click "Start Recording" 
   - Speak/perform the selected sample type
   - Watch the real-time waveform
   - Click "Stop Recording" when done

3. **Analyze**:
   - Click "Analyze Voice Pattern"
   - Wait for AI analysis (2-3 seconds)
   - View results and interpretations

### 3. Understanding Results

**Risk Levels**:
- 🟢 **Low (0-33%)**: Normal patterns detected
- 🟡 **Medium (33-66%)**: Some patterns of interest
- 🔴 **High (66-100%)**: Notable patterns warrant attention

**Scores**:
- **Respiratory**: Analysis of breathing/cough patterns
- **Neurological**: Analysis of voice quality markers
- **Confidence**: How reliable the analysis is
