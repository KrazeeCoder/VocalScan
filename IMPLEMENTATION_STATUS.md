- ✅ Neurological Analysis: MFCCs, pitch/jitter/shimmer, voice quality metrics
- ✅ Automated model selection based on performance
- ✅ Confidence scoring and risk level calibration
- ✅ Pattern interpretation with user-friendly explanations

### DevOps & Setup
- ✅ Automated setup script
- ✅ Windows batch files for easy startup
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Demo script showing functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   python demo.py  # See it working immediately
   ```

2. **Start Backend:**
   ```
   start-backend.bat
   ```

3. **Start Frontend (new terminal):**
   ```
   start-frontend.bat  
   ```

4. **Open Browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### For Respiratory Analysis (Cough/Breath):
- Records 10-20s audio samples
- Extracts mel-spectrograms and acoustic features
- Detects patterns associated with respiratory anomalies
- Returns risk score 0-1 with interpretation

### For Neurological Analysis (Voice/Speech):
- Analyzes sustained vowels, sentences, general speech
- Extracts MFCC, pitch, jitter, shimmer features
- Detects vocal patterns associated with neurological conditions
- Provides voice quality assessment

### Risk Levels:
- **Low (0-0.33)**: Normal patterns detected
- **Medium (0.33-0.66)**: Some patterns of interest  
- **High (0.66-1.0)**: Notable patterns warrant attention

## 📊 Demo Results

The demo shows realistic analysis patterns:
- Voice samples: Focus on neurological markers
- Cough/breath: Focus on respiratory patterns
- Confidence scores based on sample quality/duration
- User-friendly interpretations with next steps

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack:
- Flask web framework
- scikit-learn, LightGBM for ML
- librosa for audio processing
- NumPy/SciPy for numerical computing

### Frontend Stack:  
- Next.js 14 with React 18
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web Audio API for recording

### ML Pipeline:
- Feature extraction → Model prediction → Risk calibration → Interpretation

## 💡 Ready for Production

The implementation includes:
- ✅ Scalable ML architecture
